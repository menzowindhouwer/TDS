		<p>
			The TDS <b>IPA Console</b> is an on-screen keyboard
			for typing characters and diacritics in the
			<a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/ipachart.html" target="other">International
			Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>. The Console is a Java Web Start
			application which allows you to easily generate 
			and paste strings of IPA symbols in <a
			href="http://www.unicode.org/" target="other">Unicode</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Console includes the complete set of IPA characters and diacritics, and
			a few non-IPA favorites. You can also add user-defined buttons for arbitrary
			Unicode characters. In addition, the Console can be used to import legacy IPA
			text from the SIL IPA and SIL IPA 93 encodings.

					The IPA Console requires version 1.6 of the Jave Runtime Environment (JRE) and
					Java Web Start. Because this version provides important functionality improvements and bug
					fixes, the Console is not available in a form that will run with earlier versions.
					If you do not have the right version of Java, go to
					<b><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="other">this
					page</a></b> and download the <span style="font-family: helvetica, sans-serif;

					Make sure that you have version 1.6 of the Jave Runtime
					Environment (JRE), and that your browser starts Java Web
					Start (<tt>javaws</tt>) once it downloads a JNLP file
					(<tt>application/x-java-jnlp-file</tt>). 
					The IPA Console was tested on the Microsoft Windows (2000 and XP), Linux (Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron) and OS X (10.5 Leopard) platforms. If you experience problems on any other platform send an email to <a href="mailto:M.A.Windhouwer@uva.nl">Menzo Windhouwer</a>.

				<p>
					Clipboard interaction between the IPA Console, well any Java program, and some
					applications, namely Firefox and Thunderbird, seems to be broken in Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron. At this moment
					its unclear where the problem lies. Luckily X Windows is a "two level" or "two layer" clipboard.
					Although the first layer (typical copy and paste layer, accessed and used via the ctrl-c, ctrl-v,
					and ctrl-x key combinations) is broken, the second layer still functions. To copy using the second
					layer of the clipboard: highlight the symbols in the Console, and then go to another window and paste
					immediately by putting your cursor where you want the text to be inserted, and then click your mouse wheel to paste.

					Apple develops its own port of the Java Development Kit, which is only available for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) running on an Intel-based Mac capable of running 64-bit applications). The IPA Console "system tray" functionality isn't (properly) support by OS X, so for now its disabled on a Mac. We still have only very limited experience with the IPA Console on OS X, and we'll be happy with any <a href="mailto:M.A.Windhouwer@uva.nl">feedback</a> on the user experience.

				<p>
					Accepting the digital signature will grant the IPA Console full access to your
					system. We assure you that we are not up to any foul play, but you
					should only use this version if you trust us (and are reasonably
					confident that we are who we say we are). <img src="gfx/face-smile.png"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do not want to accept our digital certificate, use the link below
					to run an unsigned version of the IPA Console. Java will execute it in a
					"sandbox" designed to shield you from rogue programs, and therefore this
					version has some limitations: You will have to grant access to the system
					clipboard every time you start the Console, and the "system tray"
					functionality will be disabled.

					Yes, but to do so you have to start the cache viewer of Java Web Start. On
					Linux/Unix, run <tt>javaws -viewer</tt> from a shell; on Windows, select
					<b>Run</b> from the Start menu and execute <tt>javaws -viewer</tt>. The
					cache viewer will show you a list of known Web Start applications. Select
					the IPA Console, and use the right mouse button to display the context
					menu. (On OS X, click while holding down the Command button). The context
					menu contains the option to <i>Install shortcuts.</i> Selecting that option
					will create a desktop icon (Linux and Windows), a Start Menu entry
					(Windows) and an entry in the Software Control Panel
					(Windows). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately the java support for the icons is buggy:
					If you move the icon, it may keep returning to the place where it was first created.

				<a name="labioflap">
					<i>Why does the Console provide three different characters
					for the labiodental flap?</i>
				</a>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					The labiodental flap, the most recent character to be
					added to the IPA (in 2005), has just been added in version 5.1 of
					the Unicode specification, at codepoint U+2C71. However, most Unicode fonts
					don't yet provide a glyph for it. SIL fonts do but
					in the non-standard "private use area", but this is
					incompatible with non-SIL fonts. Hence, the "Other Symbols" section of the Console includes a key
					for the SIL codepoint and for a look-alike, the Cyrillic
					character <i>izhitsa</i> (&#x0475;).
