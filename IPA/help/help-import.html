            Use this tab to convert legacy text to Unicode. It can import
	    text written with older, pre-unicode SIL fonts such as SIL
	    Doulos IPA and SIL Doulos IPA 93, or any other font using a
            compatible encoding.
	<p>
	    Select the correct version of the SIL encoding at the top of the
            import area.
        <p>
	    To import text, paste it into the import area and press the
            <b>convert</b> button. The unicode equivalent will appear in the
            buffer area. Note that you can import text even if you do not
            have the original font installed (e.g., if somebody sent you a
            document with SIL IPA symbols).
        <p>
            In Windows, there are two possible modes for text to be pasted
            into the Console. If you see odd results, press the
            <b>try&nbsp;alternate&nbsp;mode</b> button and then try 
	    <b>convert</b> again.
