                The TDS IPA Console is brought to you by the TDS Project.

			Use the <b>Console buttons</b> to compose an IPA string in the buffer area, then
			press <b>Cut</b> or <b>Copy</b> to put it on the system clipboard. You can then paste it
			into any text editor or other application that supports cutting and pasting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Characters supported by your <b>computer
			keyboard</b> can also be entered by simply typing
			them. The <b>Backspace</b> and <b>Delete</b> keys
			can be used to edit the generated string.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Non-spacing diacritics</b> (accents etc.) must be entered after the
			character they modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			The console is <b>extensible:</b> The second and third tabs have space for user-selected
			symbols. You can define new buttons that insert any Unicode character (not just from
			the IPA subset). User-defined buttons will be remembered for future Console sessions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many <b>fonts</b> do not provide the full set of IPA symbols. The Console will try to select
			a complete font when it starts up. Use the list next to the character buffer to change
			the font of the text you type. Use the Settings tab to change the font used on the
			symbol buttons. If you don't have a suitable Unicode font, you can <a
			href="http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/ipa/#IPAfonts">download fonts</a> from the
			internet. Note that symbols will be correctly inserted even if you do not have a
			font that can display them. (They will appear correctly on another computer, or if you
			install a suitable font later).
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>Import IPA</b> tab can be used to import (convert to Unicode) text that
			was written using the older non-unicode fonts published by SIL, or other
			compatible fonts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>Settings</b> tab allows you to customize the operation of the program. Changes
			in the settings will be remembered for future Console sessions.
		</p>
		<p> In the Settings tab, you can choose whether to
		<b>compose</b> 
		characters and diacritics whenever Unicode provides a
		combined character. Combined characters look better, but the
		diacritic cannot be separated from the base
		character during later editing. 
		</p>
		<p>
		        The IPA Console can stay resident as an icon in the <b>system tray</b> (for window managers that
		        support it). Because of security restrictions, this
		        feature is not available with the unsigned version
		        of the Console (see <a
		        href="http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/ipa/#unsigned">here</a>
		        for more information).

					Better support for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). The preferred Arial Unicode MS font is called ArialUnicodeMS on a Mac. The IPA Console system tray functionality isn't (properly) supported on OS X.

					Upgraded to Unicode 5.1. This version of Unicode has an official codepoint for the labiodental flap (U+2C71), which is now used in the pulmonic consonants table. The look-alike has been added to the other symbols.

					The default is now to put the Unicode text in all formats on the clipboard. The known word processors pick the most proper format by default. There is still an option on the settings tab to put just plain text on the clipboard.

					The clipboard format setting drop down has been simplified. Persistent settings have been made independent of the actual labels used in the settings tab.

                    Finetuned the HTML clipboard format so it doesn't append a superfluous newline. Unfortunately Microsoft Word 2000 still needs the &lt;tt/> wrapper to listen to all the font information in all cases. Added shortcut entries to the clipboard format settings for tested word processors (Microsoft Word 2000, 2003, WordPad and OpenOffice.org Writer).

                    Microsoft Word 2000 doesn't listen to the RTF font information, so the default clipboard format is now HTML which works in all (tested) cases.
